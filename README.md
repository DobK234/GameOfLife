# GameOfLife
Game of Life implemented in Python, with a GUI coded using the Tk GUI toolkit

The Game of Life is a classic zero-player game in which the user selects several cells to make them "alive", runs the program, and many cycles are ran during which some cells are killed and others live on, decided by internal logic.

This allowed me to really push my understanding of logic in order to code the part which decides what each cycle looks like.

It also improved my ability to create GUIs in Python as I familiarised myself with the Tk GUI toolkit.
